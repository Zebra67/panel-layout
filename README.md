## Panel Layout

![CI](https://github.com/GradleUp/auto-manifest/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

Panel Layout is a UI library for Android that allows you to display a floating and resizable panel that can also snap to the edges.

Panel Layout makes use of [ConstraintLayout](https://developer.android.com/training/constraint-layout) to lay out panel with rest of the content.

This library is inspired by a good iOS UI framework: [PanelKit](https://github.com/louisdh/panelkit)
